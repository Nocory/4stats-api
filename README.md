# 4stats-API

The ***4stats-API*** serves as a middleman between the ***Gatherer*** and the ***Client***.

The ***API*** continuously receives updates from the ***Gatherer***, which it then forwards to any connected ***Clients***, that have established a socket connection.

It also offers endpoints for board-stats, active-threads and board-history requests.
